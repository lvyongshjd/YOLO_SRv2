In the latest YOLOSRv2 paper, we have expanded the dataset. The number of pictures was increased from 6,000 to 11,104 and the number of instances was increased from 16,409 to 28,381. Due to the large size of the files, we have adopted the sharing method of Baidu Netdisk. The specific link is as follows：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1y8tWlsduJO1yaWllyV-aYQ and extraction code：bj72.
